# Keystore-Class
Retrieve and display the self-signed certificate

A Java KeyStore (JKS) is a repository of security certificates – either authorization certificates or public key certificates – plus corresponding private keys, used for instance in SSL encryption.

In IBM WebSphere Application Server and Oracle WebLogic Server, a file with extension jks serves as keystore.
